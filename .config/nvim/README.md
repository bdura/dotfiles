# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Todos

- [ ] Make sure the file picker (whether Telescope of `fzf-lua`) can find hidden files, or git-untracked files.
- [ ] Use `fzf-lua` instead of Telescope? Before we do that, I'd like to make sure that `<Esc>` does not quit the picker,
      but enters "normal" mode so I can use Vim motions to navigate results and the query.
